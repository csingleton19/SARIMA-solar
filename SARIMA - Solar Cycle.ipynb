    "### About SARIMA\n",
    "\n",
    "SARIMA = Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal: Is like it sounds, this is the seasonality contribution to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoregressive: Autoregression is when the variable you are interested in is forecasted using a linear combination of past values. Essentially, it is a regression against itself. Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation are used to find optimal p values. Autocorrelation will consider the effect of a variable in the past, and effects of other variables on it. Partial autocorrelation will only measure the direct values between current and past values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated: Integration is the differencing applied to data to check the mean and variance. A dickery-fuller test is run on the data to make it stationary, or level, and check for the aformentioned mean and variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving Average: Moving average is a regression-like past-error model. The error can only be found after fitting the model, and it represents the random deviations between the variable and the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline details:\n",
    "\n",
    "The decomposition will give hints as to the p,q values, where p represents autoregression and q represents the moving average. ACF (aucorrelation) and PACF (partial autocorrelation) tests are good to find potential p values. The adfuller test will tell whether the data is stationary (p-value < .05 & adf > critical value), or needs diffing (p-value >= .05).\n",
    "\n",
    "The test-train split ratio is 80:20\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(p, d, q) represents the non-seasonal part of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "(P, D, Q, m) represents the seasonal part of the model - where P, D, Q can be found from the same parts as the non-season section, and m is the observation frequency (1 hour in this particular case). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes, Limitations, and Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "My local machine doesn't have the RAM to run this as of now, hence why the p, q, d and P, Q, D values are currently blank. They will be filled once the appropriate values are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further my understanding (and also just general curiosity) I think I'm going to run the model as is without the test-train split by commenting it out- and while it is running on the distributed computing cluster, I will update this with the actual test-train split. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: the main weakness from this model will probably come from the amount of data that was thrown away (>90%), and the amount of data that was generated using the Interpolate Refill Sample method. There was ~186,000 values before the resampling, and ~334,000 values after. Only ~55% of the total data is original. This could potentially be improved by predicting the gaps using previous data, as opposed to a resampling method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional future work could include checking different time intervals and comparing the results, and trying other filters with the same process."

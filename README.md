# SARIMA-solar

This is a barebones version of a SARIMAX model I have run before on Azure but formatted to a local machine. Due to RAM constraints I am not able to run it right now, but it is the framework of the model I'll use whenever I do get a new machine capable of running it. It will also serve as an introductory guide to anyone who wants a quick explanation on SARIMAX models. The end goal I want to use this for is to see if I can buid a (near) real-time solar monitoring system for early warning solar flare dection.
